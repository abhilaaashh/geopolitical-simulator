PLAYER CHARACTER: {{PLAYER_ACTOR_NAME}} ({{PLAYER_ACTOR_TYPE}})
PLAYER CAPABILITIES:
- Military: {{MILITARY_SCORE}}/100

- Diplomatic: {{DIPLOMATIC_SCORE}}/100
- Popular Support: {{POPULAR_SCORE}}/100

CURRENT WORLD STATE:
{{WORLD_STATE}}

PROPOSED ACTION:
{{PLAYER_ACTION}}

EVALUATE THE ACTION:

1. FEASIBILITY CHECK
- Does the player have the resources/authority to attempt this?
- Is this physically/logistically possible?
- Does this align with the actor's established capabilities?

2. PLAUSIBILITY CHECK
- Would this actor realistically consider this action?
- Are there obvious real-world constraints being ignored?
- Is the scale/scope reasonable?

3. RISK ASSESSMENT
- What are the obvious risks the player might not be considering?
- Are there likely unintended consequences?

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "isValid": true/false,
  "warnings": [
    "Warning 1: specific concern",
    "Warning 2: specific concern"
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Alternative approach 1",
    "Modified version that might work better"
  ]
}

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Be permissive, not restrictive. The game should allow bold/risky moves.
- Only mark as invalid if truly impossible (e.g., landlocked country launching naval invasion)
- Warnings should inform, not discourage
- Suggestions should be helpful alternatives, not mandatory
- Creative/unconventional actions should generally be allowed with appropriate warnings
