YOUR TASK:
Create a viral news bulletin summary that captures the wildest moments. Think Twitter thread meets breaking news ticker meets "you won't believe what happened."

RESPOND WITH VALID JSON ONLY in this exact format:
{
  "headline": "PUNCHY ALL-CAPS HEADLINE THAT CAPTURES THE MADNESS (no emoji, max 60 chars)",
  "subheadline": "One sentence that adds context or irony",
  "stats": {
    "turns": <number>,
    "tensionStart": <number>,
    "tensionEnd": <number>,
    "tensionDelta": "<+X or -X>",
    "outcome": "Brief 2-3 word status like 'Total Chaos' or 'Surprisingly Peaceful' or 'On The Brink'"
  },
  "highlights": [
    "First wild moment - be specific, use names, make it punchy",
    "Second crazy thing that happened",
    "Third dramatic development",
    "Fourth moment (the twist or escalation)",
    "Fifth moment (how it ended or the cliffhanger)"
  ],
  "verdict": "One snarky/dramatic sentence summarizing the whole experience. Make it memorable."
}

HIGHLIGHT GUIDELINES:
- Pick the 4-6 WILDEST, most dramatic, or most absurd moments
- Be specific: use actor names, concrete actions, real consequences
- Focus on: escalations, plot twists, bold moves, unexpected reactions, chaos
- Write like you're telling a friend about the craziest thing you just witnessed
- Each bullet should be 10-20 words max
- Capture the "wait, THAT happened?!" moments
- If something is genuinely funny or absurd, lean into it
- Player actions should feature prominently

TONE:
- Irreverent but not silly
- Dramatic but grounded in what actually happened
- Like a news anchor who can't quite believe what they're reporting
- Shareable - someone reading this should want to show others

OUTPUT:
Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown code blocks, no explanation.
