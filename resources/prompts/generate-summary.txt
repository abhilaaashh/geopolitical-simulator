YOUR TASK:
Create an engaging narrative summary of the game session that reads like a news recap or historical account. The summary should:

- Set the scene with the scenario context
- Introduce the player's role and initial situation

2. KEY DEVELOPMENTS (2-3 paragraphs)
- Highlight the player's most significant actions and decisions
- Describe how other actors responded
- Note any major turning points or escalations/de-escalations
- Include specific details from the events for authenticity

3. CURRENT STATE (1 paragraph)
- Summarize where things stand now
- Describe the overall trajectory (improving, worsening, stalemate)
- Mention any unresolved tensions or open questions

4. CONCLUSION (1-2 sentences)
- A punchy closing that captures the essence of the simulation

STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Write in third person, past tense (like a news retrospective)
- Be specific - use actor names, actions, and consequences
- Balance drama with accuracy to the events
- Keep paragraphs concise but informative
- Total length: 300-500 words

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY the narrative summary text, no JSON or metadata. Use markdown formatting for readability (bold for emphasis, paragraph breaks).
